# Pulley Adapter Mod
This is an adapter modification to allow for anyone using the Beefy Front Idler mod to also use this mod. This replaces the front top Adapter blocks with a block that has one M5 and one M3 hole instead of 2x M5 holes. The Adapter was also shortened to better match the BFI flange that this would sit on top of.
