I welcome users to submit mods, but not everyoneâ€™s printer is the same as yours, and often I cannot verify your mod.

Therefore, please do not modify the original files. Instead, create a new folder under the 'usermod' directory with your name and place your mod in this folder. Please also provide a brief introduction explaining why users should use your mod.

It's not mandatory, but it would be even better if you could refer the requirements of VORON.
